As its name says (\"notebook\"), it is designed for users to program with readability and modularization in mind. \n","\n","In a notebook, individual block of code execution is done within a _cell_. All cells in the same notebook live within the same process and namespace scope. You can put explanation of the code (or beyond, like physics for which the code is developed) in a _markdown_ cell. Such explanation can go per code cell. We don't write a software in a notebook, but usually a higher level program (such as _main_ function) with an explanation of what's going on.\n","\n","Though originally developed for Julia, Python and R (hence \"Jupyter\"), now it supports all kinds of programming language including shell and even fortran(!). Many scientific blog posts are also done in a notebook and blogs to teach you about Jupyter (like [this one](http://arogozhnikov.github.io/2016/09/10/jupyter-features.html#Writing-formulae-in-latex)).\n","\n","## Default code engine\n","When you start a notebook, you choose the default backend of the notebook.
