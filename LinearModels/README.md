# Linear Models 

This directory contains a notebook to practice a linear classification and regression models.

* [Introduction00-LinearModels.ipynb](/LinearModels/Introduction00-LinearModels.ipynb)
  * Implements simple linear models for toy dataset. You will program the models and optimization functions by yourself. A [solution](/LinearModels/Introduction00-LinearModels-Solution.ipynb) is available for an exercise.
* [Introduction01-LinearModels-Pytorch.ipynb](/LinearModels/Introduction01-LinearModels-Pytorch.ipynb)
  * This notebook re-implement linear models covered by the first notebook using PyTorch, which we will use in more advanced examples of neural networks. A [solution](/LinearModels/Introduction01-LinearModels-Pytorch-Solution.ipynb) is available for an exercise.

Notebooks will be covered during the introductory lectures in KMI school 2020.

You can run these notebooks using the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/drinkingkazu/slacml-kmi2020/HEAD?filepath=LinearModels).
